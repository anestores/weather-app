## About Weather App

Welcome to the Weather App. The purpose of this app is to give Japan tourist a snapshot of the current weather in Japan's major tourist destinations. It will also enable them to easily search for places of interest in each of the cities.

## Tech Stack

For this project i used the following:

- Laravel
- VueJS

## Notes

- Add a CITIES environment variable in the .env file to define cities that you like and separating them with a comma (example: CITIES=Tokyo,Yokohama,Kyoto,Osaka,Sapporo,Nagoya). You can add other cities or destinations as well.
- Add your OpenWeather API key in the .env file (OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=xxx)
- Add your FourSquare API key in the .env file (FOURSQUARE_API_KEY=xxx)

My UI/UX design is simple and straightforward. My code is also easy to understand.

That's why I think it's the best design for the Weather App project. Thank you :)
